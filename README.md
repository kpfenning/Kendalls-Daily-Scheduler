# Kendalls-Daily-Scheduler
A daily scheduler that allows user to input events for each hour of their work day. The to-do's are saved to the local storage so even if you were to exit the page and come back or even just refreshing the page, you to-do's will remain saved on the page! This is a great webpage to use if the user is an individual who loves to time block!

## Description 

When a user goes to this Barbie inspired webpage, they will see the current date as well as time blocks for the typical working day hours (7am-5am). Within those time blocks the user may enter their tasks for each hour of the work day. Once the user enters a task for a center hour, they can click the save button that is on the far right side in order to save their task to the local storage. The user can come back to this planner at any time and they will see their tasks have been saved to the page. Not only can they save their tasks, the time blocks will change color based on the time of day in comparison to the specific time block. When the time block background changes to gray, that means that the specific hour has passed. When the time block's background is red, that means that is the current hour of the day. Finally, if the time block background is green that means that time block has not happened yet.
